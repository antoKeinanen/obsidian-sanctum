# Sanctum Reborn

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a fork from [jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum](https://github.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum) as the original maintainer has gone inactive.

Sanctum’s a minimalist theme for creating a serene space of retreat, for thought and uninterrupted work.

## Installation

You can also manually install Sanctum by:

1. Downloading the CSS file and moving it into the folder `.obsidian/themes/` located in your vault folder;
2. Rename the css file to `Sanctum.css`;
3. In Obsidian, go to `Settings ➞ Appearance ➞ Themes ➞ Reload themes`, and select `Sanctum`.

## Disclaimer

The following theme significantly alters Obsidian's original css, and so is prone to breaking upon new Obsidian updates, as well as being incompatible with custom css snippets, which might require specific adjustments. If you have any issues feel free to open a issue.

## Recommended Plugins

- [Smart Typography](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography): for a better and coherent writing experience
- [Contextual Typography](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-contextual-typography): For a better typographic experience, and access to some of the theme's features
- [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings): for tons of customization options

## Design Principles

**Intentional**

- This theme was made with the intent of clarifying Obsidian's UI, reducing the unnecessary clutter and keeping what's essential for an enjoyable and intuitive experience;
- Greyscale palette is the same both for light as well as dark theme;
- Colour is also used for contrast when hovering and activating elements.

**Consistent**

- Every element is styled according to a predetermined grid, scale, animations (based on IBM's Carbon Design System) and colours - this conveys consistency throughout the theme;
- The theme was created with the intention of using only one workhorse font family, used everywhere, but styled differently. Thus the theme comes with only 1 font family - IBM Plex
- Offer a similar enjoyable experience, independently of screen size or device.

**Clean**

- Use of calming colours, only used either to convey importance, or in the note file itself;
- The background colour is the same in every element, to reduce visual noise and give a more calming atmosphere;
- Elements are related to each other using the rules of visual _gestalt_. This means that they're grouped by proximity, in a common region or as a focal point.
